Art is a vast realm of expression, encompassing a multitude of styles and forms. This dynamic field witnesses an ongoing interplay between classical traditions and the emergence of new, contemporary expressions.

For example, think back to when Dadaism first appeared; many people didn't get it. They thought it was strange and didn't fit the traditional mold. However, it paved the way for innovative movements like abstract expressionism and pop art. Even graffiti art was met with resistance at first, and now we have digital art, which is becoming more and more popular.

Some people engage with art casually, while others discover hidden talents within themselves. Art is an inclusive world, allowing participation even for those without traditional artistic skills.

In essence, art, while it may not be everyone's favorite, remains a space for diverse and profound expression. History shows us that resistance to new art often turns into appreciation over time, making art an ever-evolving tapestry of expression.",0,2023-10-11T01:29:52Z

Artistic skill is subjective. At 1st glance and to some in general, a Rothko painting might lack artistic skill. Some may view it as scribbles and paint splash. 

Anyway, I've had this discussion countless times & as much as I'd like to engage you in this wonderful discussion, at this precise moment, I find myself a little tired. So please accept the following text, which I'm copying and pasting here from one of my previous back and forth discussions on youtube comments. I'm disclosing this in case you ever encounter it elsewhere. But it addresses precisely what you're talking about, I say what I say from experience, having extensively made an enormous collection of AI generated art and from interacting and appreciating other artists' works, its out of respect of your opinion (for I once held the same thought) that I'd like you to read the following so that maybe you might understand the implications of AI generated Art in the context of Artistic merit, its long, but I hope you'll read it: 

In the realm of art, there exists a spectrum of sophistication. On one end, there are those who provide generic instructions such as ""Cat with a hat at the Beach,"" resulting in creations that fall short of established artists and animators. However, at the other end of the spectrum, we encounter highly skilled digital artists who have elevated prompt engineering to an art form worthy of awe. These creators infuse their AI-assisted designs with the essence of their own minds and the passion of their souls. These outputs truly stand out amidst the sea of uninspiring AI-generated works. They deserve our admiration, and their efforts epitomize the essence of true artists.

Just as anyone can wield a pencil and paper without skill, they may be categorised as amateurs in the world of art. Similarly, in the intersection of art and AI, there are amateurs and there proficient practitioners, commanding deep knowledge of prompt guidance and complex instructions crafting genuinely original creations that can't be duplicated It's essential to remember that when discussing AI-generated art, the ultimate genesis lies within the human mind, as these creations wouldn't exist without human initiative.

Uniqueness is another facet of this fascinating landscape. No two adept digital artists envision the same artwork. Some individuals, not well-versed in traditional painting or drawing, harness the human imagination to conceive initial drafts, which they subsequently reverse engineer into a prompt or modify using AI. Others blend various AI-generated elements to craft entirely new artistic pieces, akin to the methods employed by notable pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Fox Lichtenstein. Are we to assert that their works lack artistic merit? I firmly believe that their creations merit all the respect one can give to a formidable artist.

These common prompts everyone is now familiar with, such as the one you've described, ""teddy bear sitting in the..."" are the entry level. Think of them like colouring books for children. It's a starting point accessible to everyone, then for those who truly are interested, there's a deeper and expansive world to explore, just as with any interest we discover deeper layers the further we progress in our development. There's more to this than just one-liner prompts. There's a world that intermingles prose, descriptive writing, and technical digital illustrative skills. These are domains that recruit immense mental creativity. Creativity isn't dead. It's found a new outlet.

This territory is novel, and given sufficient time for the field to mature, I hold a confident outlook that artworks collaboratively generated by humans in conjunction with AI image generators, along with the emergence of more advanced AI tools, will undoubtedly earn their place within the annals of art. We stand on the cusp of witnessing the emergence of pioneering legends in this burgeoning field.",0,2023-12-15T12:28:51Z

Did Stephen King write The Shining? Yes. Did Stephen King bring The Shining to life as visual representation of his own story via film? No. This is an excellent example because there exists an alternate version of The Shining that follows the book more closely and, where, King had a more direct involvement in its direction. Visually, it is completely separate from Kubrick‚Äôs version. Writing is an equal but separate skill form. Like a painter painting an image, uploading the image for ai to convert into a novel (written entirely by ai using an image for reference) and then calling themselves a writer. They are no more a writer than the person prompting ai to create an image is a visual artist. Now they even have prompting for prompts. So, now, ai is writing prompts for itself. All you have to do is give it a vague set of visual instructions like ‚ÄúTeddy bear sitting in the snow wearing cowboy boots.‚Äù Prompt generator creates the rest.

2. Device Compatibility: The app developer may have made the app compatible with certain device models. If your device is not on this list, you may not be allowed to download the app.

3. Google Play Country: The app may be available in certain countries. If the country in your device's Google Play account is outside the app's distribution region, you may receive an incompatibility error.

4. Google Play Not Updated: Sometimes the Google Play Store app itself may not be updated, which can lead to incompatibility issues. You can update the Play Store and try again.
You can update your device's software to resolve this issue.

Additionally, in Google Play Apps, it is up to the app developer to determine whether the app is compatible with your device. You need to communicate this issue to the application developer.",1,2025-06-12T14:58:42Z

No serious work can be done on a small phone screen. Meanwhile, professional users with premium tablets are locked out of the beta.

fE1_nHllIp8,False,,UgxncVshdU0IONv5eEN4AaABAg,UCF_DQZFRvjTHmKcTy1wOzQA,@TrevorDennis100,"A trick I suspect a lot of user miss is that we can use a lot of Photoshop's tools directly to a layer mask.  Alt/Opt clicking the mask, so we see just the mask, makes it easier to see any effects you apply.  You can apply filters like Render Clouds to make a layer's cover less uniform.  Brush Strokes > Spatter to break up the mask's outline.  Liquify to bend and stretch the mask ‚Äî useful for creating explosion effects, although you could do this directly to the image in most situations.  You can use the Magic Wand to select the whites or blacks, and then modify the selection with expand or contract to move the mask into the masked object ‚Äî useful for blurring the objects outline with Mask Properties > Feather.  This is a tiny fraction of ways you can edit a mask.",12,2024-11-15T22:40:18Z
